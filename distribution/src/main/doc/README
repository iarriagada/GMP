The Gemini Master Process (GMP), the communication broker in the GIAPI model

GMP Version: \${gmp.version}

## PACKAGE

The GMP is delivered as tar.gz or rpm package containing all the binaries and
configuration required to run the server

The following details the files and directories included in the package

/README.txt

/bin
Scripts and binaries to launch the GMP server
/bin/start.sh
Bash script used to launch the GMP at the console
/bin/start.sh

/bin/runner.args
Arguments passed to pax-runner
/bundles
All the bundles that compose the gmp server stored as a maven repository
/conf
Configuration files
/conf/services
Configuration files of specific OSGi services. These files are observed at
runtime and modifications are reflected on the running services
/felix

/logs

When the application is launched a directory under /bin/runner is created that
contains a cache of the binaries. The directory can be deleted freely

## RPM INSTALLATION

The GMP is also provided as an RPM. To install it do the command:

    sudo rpm -ivh --ignoreos gmp-server-${project.rpmversion}-${buildNumber}.i386.rpm

The rpm is really meant for an installation in Gemini environment and makes some
assumptions on the system where is installed:

- GMP will be installed at \$GEMINI_TOP/opt/gpi/gmp-server
- A software user will be created if it doesn't exist (gmp will run under software user)
- A init script for gmp is provided at \$GEMINI_TOP/opt/gpi/gmp-server/bin/gmp-server
- You can copy this file to /etc/init.d
- After copying the file you can verify it will be started when the machine is rebooted by issuing:
  /sbin/chkconfig --list gmp-server
  gmp-server 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

For proper reboot operation the software user needs sudo access with the following
directives that need to be added to /etc/sudoers file

Defaults:software !requiretty

software ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
software ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/chkconfig
software ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/\*

## REQUIREMENTS

The only set requirement is a Java 1.8 or higher installation. You can verify it
with the command:

    java -version

## RUNNING AS DAEMON

A script is provided to run the GMP in daemon mode, to do so invoke:
./gmp-server-ctl.sh start

gmp-server-ctl.sh needs that the GPI_ROOT environment variable be defined. It will try
to find the gmp server under \$GPI_ROOT/gmp-server

This will launch the gmp-server-ctl.sh in the background

Additionally a gmp-server script is provided that can be used as an init.d script, for which
you need to copy it to /etc/init.d/ and run \$ chkconfig --add gmp-server, or you can run it directly
from the original location. It needs to be run as root though.

The script can take one of the following parameters:

start: that starts the GMP if no other GMP instance is running
stop: that stops a running GMP. If the GMP doesn't go down gracefully, for instance in case of
a bundle in an infinite loop, it will force the process to exit.
status: tells whether the GMP is running
kill: forcefully kills the GMP

## TELNET

A telnet daemon is included that gives access to the shell with several commands
that can be used to manage the application. To reach the server type

    telnet localhost 15001

To exit the console press CTRL+D

NOTE: There is a bug in the telnet daemon, if you press CTRL+C to exit the
telnet client will hang. This doesn't affect the GMP.

NOTE2: There is no security, anybody can reach the telnet daemon

## DOCS

The documentation in HTML format is available at the docs dir or through the local
web server at
http://localhost:8888/docs/

## LOGS

The main log file can be found at logs/gmp.log

The log file is rotated daily

A second file contains the results of the standard output if gmp is run as a daemon.
The file is located at logs/gmp-server.out

## WEB CONSOLE

A Web interface to the GMP OSGi container is available at

http://localhost:8888/admin

## RUNNING STANDALONE

To start the GMP in standalone mode go to the /bin directory and invoke:

./start.sh

At the end of the start the process should be running and there will be a prompt
in the screen.

Type:

lb

to see all the services that are running. You should get something similar to:

g! lb
