 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Gemini Master Process (GMP) is a Gemini-provided component that provides
 * the bulk of the Gemini features and integration functionality for instruments
 * that use the GIAPI to interface with Gemini.
 *
 * The GMP encapsulates and handles the details of all communication with
 * current Gemini software. The GMP interfaces with the instrument via one or more implementations of the
 * language-specific API or GIAPI glue.
 * This way, the instrument is only concerned with the
 * details of the GIAPI as documented in the language-specific glue API ICDs.
 *
 * A simple instrument that shows the relationship between builder code, the
 * Gemini Master Process and the language-specific API glue is shown below.
