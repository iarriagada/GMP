<!--
    This configuration file contains the description of EPICS channels
    that will be simulated in the GMP.

    Each channel must have the following parameters:
         name : The name of the EPICS channel that will be simulated
         type : Data type of the epics channel. Valid data types are
                FLOAT, DOUBLE, SHORT, STRING, BYTE. Uppercase or lowercase
                values are accepted
         size : Integer value that describes the number of elements the
                EPICS channel will contain when updated in simulation.
    updateRate: Integer value to describe the time in seconds to be used
                when the simulation is executed. This rate is used to update the
                value of the EPICS channel in simulation.
